# Slack Best Practices

### Guiding Principles to channel management
* The slower the pace of the channel, the more functions it can support

* Large channels that contain larger numbers of people should tend towards lower volume with the exception of social channels, 
keep fast moving conversation to smaller channels with focused conversations

* It should be possible to mute or opt out of noisy social channels without missing critical work information

* Start with the minimum channel requirements and split out channels by function as conversation frequency increases

* Most people should be in a few channels that contain conversation that is highly relevant to their work, and a larger number of low-volume channels that exist to widely disseminate important information

* Standardize channel names so that they're predictable and easy to discover

### Some suggestions for streamlining conversations to reduce chat clutter

* use channel topics and pinned messages to share important information or allow visitors to quickly locate relevant links

* reactions are a less noisy way to acknowledge a message, consider :pray: or :bow: or create some custom thank you emojis

* prefer threads when a conversation becomes less useful to all members of a channel 

* default to public for searchability and transparency reasons unless there’s a reason to keep channels private

* leverage reactions as an easy way to run a poll

* all conversation trends towards #random over time. You can react with [:raccoon:](https://qz.com/work/1230173/slack-has-a-solution-for-stopping-chats-the-polite-raccoon/) to politely suggest that people move to the right channel

### Be a better Slack citizen:

* profile photos with a clear photo of your face is best to facilitate connections, especially for distributed teammates. Barring that, a custom profile icon is still better than the default plaid (the Twitter egg of Slack!)

* read channel topics, channel purpose, and pinned messages when entering new channels

* update pinned messages for channels you participate in.

* set your Slack status (especially helpful for remote people) for when you're on PTO or WFH or at another office, it will appear in the text box as people interact with you 

* use formatting to highlight your text. Emoji, bold, italics are all ways to break up a wall of text to make it easier to read

* expect a `@here` / `@channel` / `@everyone` to indicate “drop everything” to most people in the channel. Use it sparingly. 

* leverage search (Command-F) to find appropriate channels for where to find appropriate channels to get support or ask questions.

* search for the name of a service to find where it’s being discussed

* test automated notifications by sending them to yourself as a DM before routing them to a public channel
