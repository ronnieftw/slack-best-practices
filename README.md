# Slack Best Practices

### Guiding Principles to channel management

* The slower the pace of the channel, the more functions it can support

* Large channels that contain larger numbers of people should tend towards lower volume with the exception of social channels, 
keep fast moving conversation to smaller channels with focused conversations

* It should be possible to mute or opt out of noisy social channels without missing critical work information

* Start with the minimum channel requirements and split out channels by function as conversation frequency increases

* Most people should be in a few channels that contain conversation that is highly relevant to their work, and a larger number of low-volume channels that exist to widely disseminate important information

* [Standardize channel names](https://github.com/ronnieftw/slack-best-practices/blob/master/channel-names.md) so that they're predictable and easy to discover

### Slack is overwhelming!! 

* set your sidebar to show only unread channels and starred channels (do this first!)
  * use [keyboard commands](#useful-keyboard-shortcuts-and-commands)
 to jump to channels that you need to find

* `/mute` channels aggressively

* use stars to keep track of messages for yourself

* use `/remind` to create a reminder for yourself, a teammate, or a channel to do something

* consider muting on-call and alert channels as well as other non-critical channels to increase focus time

* set your default DND hours for after hours

* use the [ad-hoc snooze setting](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/218551977-Reduce-noise-in-Slack#Do-Not-Disturb) for focus time

* archive channels that have outlived their usefulness

* Is a channel too noisy?
   * Is it rarely useful? - leave it
   * Is it interesting but not timely? - mute it
   * Is it sometimes very useful/interesting interspersed with a lot of cruft? - consider a channel split to create more specific channels by channel function


### Some suggestions for streamlining conversations to reduce chat clutter

* use channel topics and pinned messages to share important information or allow visitors to quickly locate relevant links

* reactions are a less noisy way to acknowledge a message, consider :pray: or :bow: or create some custom thank you emojis

* prefer threads when a conversation becomes less useful to all members of a channel 

* default to public for searchability and transparency reasons unless there’s a reason to keep channels private

* leverage reactions as an easy way to run a poll

* all conversation trends towards #random over time. You can react with [:raccoon:](https://qz.com/work/1230173/slack-has-a-solution-for-stopping-chats-the-polite-raccoon/) to politely suggest that people move to the right channel

### Be a better Slack citizen

* expect a `@here` / `@channel` / `@everyone` to indicate “drop everything” to most people in the channel. Use it sparingly. 

* read channel topics, channel purpose, and pinned messages when entering new channels and help keep them on updated 

* for work Slack teams, profile photos with a clear photo of your face is best to facilitate connections, especially for distributed teammates. Barring that, a custom profile icon is still better than the default plaid (the Twitter egg of Slack!)

* set your Slack status (especially helpful for remote people) for when you're on PTO or WFH or at another office, it will appear in the text box as people interact with you 

* use [formatting](#message-formatting) to highlight your text. Emoji, bold, italics are all ways to break up a wall of text to make it easier to read

* leverage search (Command-F) to find appropriate channels for where to find appropriate channels to get support or ask questions

* test automated notifications by sending them to yourself as a DM before routing them to a public channel


### Useful keyboard shortcuts and commands

* Command-k or Command-t brings up the quick switcher to jump to channels and DMs
* Command-`[`  or Command-left arrow goes back in your chat pane history (previous channels)
* Command-`]` or Command-right arrow goes forward 
* Command-f search 
* Command-`/`  brings up the legend for shortcuts

* Hit the up arrow while in the desktop to edit the last message you typed.

* `/collapse` to collapse all images and unfurls in the current channel

* Esc to mark all messages read in the current channel
* Shift-Esc to to mark all messages read  in all channels _Caution: there is no undo for this_

### Message formatting

* Use triple quotes to generate multiline code snippets : ```def foo```
* `_word_`  to make _italics_
* `*word*` to *bold*
* `~word~` to ~strikethrough~
* `option-8` for a bullet: •
